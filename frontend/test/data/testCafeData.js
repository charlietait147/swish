    name: 'The Orangery',
    location: 'Winchester',
    description: 'The Orangery is a relaxed and sophisticated coffee, brunch and cocktail bar in the fashionable square right outside the Cathedral grounds.  Arguably its party piece is its rather stunning interior, decorated spaciously in a botanical theme, making this one of the nicest venues to sit in and socialise with friends.  For those seeking a hearty brunch in town, we\`d recommend their wonderfully presented poached egg and avocado on toast, complemented with a white hot chocolate!',
