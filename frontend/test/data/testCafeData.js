        description: 'The Orangery is a relaxed and sophisticated coffee, brunch and cocktail bar in the fashionable square right outside the Cathedral grounds.  Arguably its party piece is its rather stunning interior, decorated spaciously in a botanical theme, making this one of the nicest venues to sit in and socialise with friends.  For those seeking a hearty brunch in town, we\`d recommend their wonderfully presented poached egg and avocado on toast, complemented with a white hot chocolate!',

        description: 'The Dispensary Kitchen is a charming and quirky cafe in the heart of Winchester, with a lovely courtyard garden out back.  The cafe is a great spot to enjoy a coffee and cake, or a light lunch, and is a popular choice for locals and tourists alike.  The cafe is also dog friendly, so you can bring your furry friend along too!  We recommend their delicious coffee and walnut cake, which is a real treat!',
