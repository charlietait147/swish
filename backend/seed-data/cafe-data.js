Arguably its party piece is its rather stunning interior, decorated spaciously in a botanical theme, making this one of the nicest venues to sit in and socialise with friends.  For those seeking a hearty brunch in town, we\`d recommend their wonderfully presented poached egg and avocado on toast, complemented with a white hot chocolate!',
